            <h1>New York Winters</h1>
            <p>As the months of November to February roll around, the intense city lines turn into a blur. Trees are now naked with their bare branches, having shed their leaves. The guests of the city, one by one, slowly return back to their suburban homes in the middle of nowhere. The streets of Times Square and 42nd Street, Bryant Park, are now quieter and not as crowded. The short and thin clothing slowly transitions to layers. New Yorkers have a love-hate relationship with the winters in the city. One’s hands and feet are constantly cold, hair gets dry and frizzy, and everyone is sniffling and sick. The days get shorter, and the sun stays hidden longer.
            </p>
            <p>However, the train stations are no longer suffocating and burning up. Instead of always dreading to reach the underground MTA train, I now speed walk in hopes of quickly getting to the insulated, warm underground systems. The once sweat-infused body odor smells of the city were reduced and trapped away with the help of being bundled up in layers. I no longer hear the birds chirping in the early cracks of dawn outside my window in the mornings. Instead, it is replaced with the eerie silence and cars passing by once in a while. I am no longer greeted with the warmth of the sun beaming through my windows. Instead, I am greeted by the cold, sharp hit of air that lingers. School starts to pick up its pace around this time as finals, exams, and sports hit. New Yorkers are now hesitant to step out of the warmth of their cozy apartments, afraid of being exposed to the painful winter air of New York. Winters in the city suck.
            </p>
            <p>On the other hand, during these four months, the city ironically gets more lively in a way. The people of New York come together as a community. Love is in the air as the holidays come around. Families come together to celebrate the holidays, have family and friend reunions, go Christmas shopping, or prepare for their annual Thanksgiving feast. As the lack of warmth causes one to seek replacement for it, I find warmth in the beauty of the winter city. People are all bundled up in puffers, scarves, and mittens, waddling through the streets. The instant snow starts to fall, you can hear New Yorkers and their inner child return, laughter and happiness radiating throughout. Spotify playlists change too, as Christmas music makes its comebacks, bringing serotonin, putting away the autumn and summer playlists that once captured intimate and enjoyable times.
            </p>
            <p>As the months come to an end, we start to reflect and reminisce about the year, all the memories made, and how much we have changed. Only you and the city see how much both of you have grown over the months: how the nights come earlier and earlier by day, how your favorite small immigrant-owned businesses start to close earlier as winter arrives, or when the sunsets are no longer pink and vibrant with warm tones but now turn cool toned. I love the winter in the city and all of its beauty.
            </p>
            <p>I once heard a quote that goes, “Change and the city will change with you.” It crosses my mind ever so often, reminding me that though yes, the city is ever changing and never staying the same, and you never know which one of your favorite small businesses is going to close permanently or when the prices of Arizona and the subway fares inflate, but that’s the beauty of it all. This is where one creates their own personalized “New York”. Some New Yorkers and their city are built off of the MTA fares being $2.90, while others remember it being $2.75; or when the old sweet lady and her food cart, who sold delicious rice noodles and fish balls’ on the corner of Grand Street, her last day ever, and how she would be retiring. No one would remember or notice these things unless these things were a part of your New York.
            </p>
            <p>New Yorkers will always have a love-hate relationship with the city, but at the end of the day, even though there are thousands of other cities in the world, to New Yorkers, we only call one our forever home, and it can never be replaced, each having stories of our own personal New York to tell.
